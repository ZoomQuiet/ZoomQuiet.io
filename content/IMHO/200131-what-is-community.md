什么是社区?
...以往...现在互联网社区越来越重要...
 
 "社区"是指关系;它是成员与其共享的价值和活动系统之间的连接媒介. 换句话说,这是人员,工具和其他元素相互联系和互动的方式. 这一点很重要. 社区不仅仅是一群无定形的人...

什么是开放社区?

-> 专门指开源技术社区了...其次,这些社区产生的源代码是"开放的",这意味着社区和公众都可以使用和修改它. 

进一步的, 开源技术社区也只是开放社区首批实例化的社区...

以往是专有软件为王, 现在开源软件在兴起...

更简单地讲,开放社区发展所遵循的共同价值观和信念不仅与它所做的事情有关,而且还与它如何做事有关. 
    
功勋主义 是很多开源社区的核心价值观...

开放社区主要通过成员的参与进行管理,而不是由指定的社区主持人进行管理(尽管可能有一个社区主持人,其作用是根据社区的精英和其他价值观来调解纠纷或进行适度的讨论). 
所有成员的参与都是为了使社区的目标和行为社会化. 例如,在开放社区中,围绕"协作","多样性","适应性","透明性"或"功勋"的价值观形成,所有成员都有责任防止和报告骚扰或任何可能破坏这些骚扰的行为价值观. 

## 反思
6年前私人偏见是这样的:

[关 乎社群:2 什么是技术社区? | DevRel | 开发者关系.思考](https://devrel.101.camp/2014-02/ac2-tech-community/)


今天, 从开源技术社区开始, 逐渐获得社会认可, 进而衍生出更加宽泛的开放社区;
对比开源技术社区, 相同的是:

- 核心目标作品
- 开放/对等/主动的协作机制
- ...


问题是, 国外学术界/商界都在积累观察/参与/讨论/分析/...开源引发的开放社区协作...

而中国互联网全员关注的只是 996 福报...

那么, 作为微小的个人, 可以为之作什么?

- 发起/运营/参与/服务各种开放社区
- 积累贡献经验, 观察/总结中国式协作技巧
- 切实通过实践影响到具体的一个个人
- 慢慢的, 传递开来, 就能形成切实的影响力以及组织/团体/社区/共同体/...

> Introduction:

**What is community?**

Heidi Hess von Ludewig

The term "community" refers to a sense of shared ownership and purpose that generates relationships of goodwill and fel- lowship between the members of a social network.

"A community" is a speci c social network united according to shared values, beliefs, and goals. In recent years (and especially since the widespread adoption of internet technologies and appli- cations), the term "community" has taken on renewed importance. Communities exist wherever people can connect—face-to-face, in shared space, or even virtually, through analog or digital media (like as ham or CB radio) or social networking applications (like Facebook). Social communities often center around religion, poli- tics, culture, geographical location, or interests. In professional and business realms, communities can be comprised of members who have similar knowledge, professions, or work roles (for in- stance, software coding, lawyers, or project managers). Research on communities has found that they provide support, enlarge net- works by enabling weak and strong network ties, disseminate information, and provide education and mentorship.

But they do something else, too: Communities de ne modes of behavior, beliefs, and roles, and in this way foster relationships between people. "Community" refers to the relationships; it is the connective medium between members and their shared value and activity systems. In other words, it's the way that people, tools, and other elements relate and engage with one another. This point is important. Communities are not just amorphous globs of people

stuck together with some beliefs; they consist of relationships that develop between and among community members and elements. Those relationships are what constitute the community; the rela- tionships make possible the feeling of fellowship and positive association between members, the activities they perform, and the way they perform them.

Communities—how they're constructed, the tools they use, how they operate—in uence the ways members connect (how they develop relationships between each other and establish relation- ships to the community at large), and the community purpose and value system is the reason those members connect. In this sense, then, the reason a community exists, how it decides to design and structure itself, the tools it decides to use, the information it dis- plays to instruct and guide members, and the people who join and participate in the community are all important considerations in building an open community, because each of these factors in u- ences the others.

**What are open communities?**

So-called "open communities" are an o shoot of open source software communities. The term "open" in "open source commu- nity" has dual meanings. First, in open source communities, community participation is "open," meaning that anyone can join the community and participate in its activities. Second, the source code these communities produce is "open," meaning that both the community and the general public can use and modify it.

At the time open source communities were created, "open" was a very new concept—one in direct opposition to prevailing wis- dom in the software industry, where proprietary software (creation, use, and access controlled by the owners of the intellectual prop- erty) was predominant. Open source communities, therefore, were among the  rst enactment of open communities and were focused on creating software. Today, however, open communities are a broader implementation of open source communities.

While all communities function in ways that align with the beliefs and values of the group, some are more explicit and deliberately re exive about the values that guide their operation. Open communities are one example of this approach to community; they concern themselves with how a community should operate. In this way, open communities foster a particular kind of relationship and bond between its members, and—in the truest sense—encourage the development of specialized activities that are supportive of its values and beliefs. More simply, the shared values and beliefs around which an open community develops has to do not only with what it does but how it does what it does.

For example, at the heart of many open communities is the value of "meritocracy," which members invoke to stress evaluation of ideas and work based on the intrinsic value of the work to the community and not on the value of the people performing the activ- ity. Other key attributes of an open community are transparency, inclusivity, adaptability, and collaboration. These shared qualities help spur the self-organizing nature of an open community. The rel- ative level of a community's degree of inclusivity, adaptability, collaboration and transparency determines that community's de- gree of "openness."

Open communities are managed predominantly through members' participation, rather than by a designated community moderator (though there may be a community moderator whose role is intended to mediate disputes or moderate discussions based on the meritocracy and other values of the community). All mem- bers participate in order to socialize the goals and behaviors of the community; for instance, in open communities are formed around values like "collaboration," "diversity," "adaptability," "trans - parency," or "meritocracy," all members are responsible for preventing and reporting harassment or any behavior that might negate these values.

Since open communities are especially concerned with how they operate, they are often able to use their shared values to in- form decision-making practices and evaluate contributions. Members therefore possess a common language for working to- gether, are able to use that language and standard of behavior to participate in collaborative work, consistently model the behaviors that align with the shared values, and—perhaps most importantly— are accountable for their actions (and trust other community mem- bers to also be accountable).
