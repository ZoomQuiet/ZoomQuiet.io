# [Letter to a young programmer](http://neopythonic.blogspot.ca/2013/10/letter-to-young-programmer.html)

Dear (insert name here),

I heard you enjoy a certain programming language named Python. Programming is a wonderful activity. I am a little jealous that you have access to computers at your age; when I grew up I didn't even know what a computer was! I was an electronics hobbyist though, and my big dream was to build my own electronic calculator from discrete components. I never did do that, but I did build several digital clocks, and it was amazing to build something that complex and see it work. I hope you dream big too — programmers can make computers (and robots!) do amazing things, and this is a great time to become a programmer. Just imagine how much faster computers will be in five or ten years, and what you will be able to do with your skills then!

知道的 Guido 好萌信,`

>>> 尝试翻译一下:

    亲:

    目测你正在享受一种叫Python 的编程语言.
    编程是种美妙的体验.
    俺很有点羡慕嫉妒恨你们 !在这个年龄就能接触电脑.
    俺那会儿子,甚至不知道什么是计算机!
    俺算一个电子爱好者,那时,最大的梦想是,亲手完成一个计算元件.
    俺从未作到这点.
    不过,倒是完成了几件数字时钟,
    每当见到如此复杂的东西,终于能工作时,哗! 那种感觉,,,
    俺期望你的梦想也足够大 —
    程序可以控制计算机(机械人)做出令人惊叹的事儿,
    这是个令程序员伟大的时代.
    现在就设想,5到10年后,能运用你的功能操作更快的计算机作到什么?! 

    哗...
